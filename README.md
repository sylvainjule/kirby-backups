# Kirby Backups

This plugin allows you to create, download and manage backups from a dedicated View. Works together with [kirby-janitor](https://github.com/bnomei/kirby3-janitor).

## 1. Installation

> Prerequisite: you must install [kirby-janitor 3+](https://github.com/bnomei/kirby3-janitor) (and the CLI per janitor's instructions) for this plugin to work.

Download and copy this repository to ```/site/plugins/backups```

Alternatively, you can install it with composer: ```composer require sylvainjule/backups```

<br/>

## 2. Usage

The plugin will work out of the box, no need for additionnal setup.

You can, however, change the prefix of the backups' filename (default is `backup-{TIMESTAMP}.zip`)

```php
// site/config.php
return [
    'sylvainjule.backups.prefix' => 'backup-',
];
```

Any backup, created either with this plugin or with any of the janitor's options (CLI, CRON job, etc), will now show up in the Backups view.

Janitor stores the backups in a `site/backups` folder. This folder isn't public and we should keep it that way. Therefore, anytime a user triggers a *Download* button, the plugin will create a copy of the given backup in a `backups-temp` folder and expose an url from there.

When the user leaves the view, copies will be deleted.

This default public `assets/backup-temp` folder can be changed to any name you'd like:

```php
// site/config.php
return [
    // backups will be copied in assets/my-secretly-public-backups
    'sylvainjule.backups.publicFolder' => 'my-secretly-public-backups',
];
```

The backups list isn't paginated because it is not intended to keep hundreds of backups around. If included in a client website, you should include a note specifying an expected frequency of backup creation / deletion (or set up a CRON job).

You can enforce a maximum number of backups by setting the `maximum` option to any integer (default is `false`).
If this number is reached the oldest backup will be deleted automatically whenever a new backup is created.

```php
// site/config.php
return [
    'sylvainjule.backups.maximum' => 5,
];
```


There's also a way to disable the "Backups" menu-item for specific user roles:

```yml
# site/blueprints/users/{role}.yml
permissions:
  access:
    backups: false
```

## 4. Credits

- The plugin relies on the Janitor plugin by [@bnomei](https://github.com/bnomei), who tweaked it a bit in order to make the development of Backups easier. üôè
